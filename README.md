# My Collection of Programs

What you will find here is just a simple selection of a few programs that I am most proud of <br />

Most things on here will include source code, if anyone is interested in seeing how it works <br />

HOWEVER, it is likely that, for bigger projects, I will NOT be including any source code, but I doubt I'll ever get to the point where I have to start worrying about leaking source code.

I will try to keep this as updated as possible, even though I really don't code that often.

Still, it is just nice to have a place where I can store everything and allow people to see what I have made (:
